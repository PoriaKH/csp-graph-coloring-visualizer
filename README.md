# csp-graph-coloring-visualizer
### Introduction
In this project i solved and visualized the famous constraint satisfaction graph coloring problem by using React and Artificial Intelligence.<br/>
In the [visualizer](https://poriakh.github.io/csp-graph-colouring-visualizer/) you'll be able to create your own graph and visualize how graph is painted step by step when backtrack search is running on background.

### Usage
Use `Add Node` to add node to your graph.(you can also double click on the screen to create node).<br/>
`Add Edge` to add edge to your graph.<br/>
you can `zoom-in` or `zoom-out`, you're also able to move the whole graph for better view.

after creating your graph click on `Solve` to see the magic.<br/><br/>
hope you enjoy :)<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
